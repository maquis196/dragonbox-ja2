/**
 * Definitions of player-controllable transport vehicles.
 *
 * The ordering in this list is important, and the game has hard-coded references to the
 * vehicles. For example, the game expects the HELICOPTER to be the 6th vehicle.
 *
 * In base vanilla game, only the Hummer, Ice-cream truck and Helicopter are available.
 *
 * Fields:
 * - enterSound: Sound file to play when a soldier enters the vehicle.
 * - moveSound: Sound file to play when the vehicle moves.
 * - profile: Profile associated to the vehicle.
 * - movementType: Determines if the vehicle can travel through map sectors and how fast. Must be one of FOOT, CAR, TRUCK, TRACKED or AIR.
 * - armourType: Determines the vehicle's protection against damage. Use the internal name of any armour items.
 * - seats: Maximum number of soldiers allowed in the vehicle. Must not be greater than 10.
